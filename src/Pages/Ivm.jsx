    <p>IUI means Intra Uterine Insemination. This procedure relies on the natural ability of sperm to fertilize an egg within the reproductive tract. It is useful in cases where infertility is caused by Cervical Mucus Incompatibility, Elevated ASA, Low Sperm Survival, High Seminal Viscosity, Poor Sperm Morphology, Unexplained Infertility, Impotence or Premature Ejaculation.

    <p>
      The IUI treatment centre is located in Allahabad, Uttar Pardesh(U.P.), India and the aim is to introduce a quantity of sperm into the uterus in order to encourage fertilization. The procedure is simple. We induce ovulation in the female partner by fertility drugs. Then place a prepared semen sample high in the uterus through a fine catheter. It is important here that at least one of the fallopian tubes of the female partner is open.
