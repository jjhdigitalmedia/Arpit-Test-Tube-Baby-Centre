    <p>In Vitro Egg Maturation or IVM - Instead of removing fully mature eggs from the ovaries and then fertilizing them,IVF Specialists remove immature eggs, ripen them in a lab dish, then add sperm. Rest of the procedure is same as IVF, time required for stimulation is reduced greatly. This may be particularly useful for women who suffer from polycystic ovarian syndrome, a hormonal disorder that disrupts ovulation.
