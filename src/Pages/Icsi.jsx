    <p className='my-3' >ICSI stand for Intra Cytoplasmic Sperm Injection also known as Micro Manipulation. The Approach to male fertility management has changed over the last few years. Patients who had compromised semen samples had to undergo years of medication and surgical manoeuvres and only few patients benefited. Now with advancement of ART techniques, conventional methods of treating male infertility has been replaced by ICSI, a proven and wholly acclaimed scientific procedure. This revolutionary technique performed by us has given fresh hope to many men whose chance for fathering their own children were slim.

    ICSI is indicated when few sperms are available or no sperms are available or IVF is not possible or unexplained fertilization failure or low fertilization in previous IVF cycles. Total azoospermia (total absence of sperm in the ejaculate) can be due either to a blockage, absence of the vas deferens or to a failure of the testes to produce spermatozoa. The degree of this failure can be variable. 90% of patients with azoospermia can be benefited by ICSI after confirming the presence of sperms in the testicular biopsy. However, the sperm that is collected is not able to fertilize the egg in the natural way and ICSI is always necessary. This leads to a fertilization rate of around 85% Sperm can be recovered either by open surgery needle or aspiration. During Microepididymal Sperm Aspiration (MESA) - the scrotum is opened and under microscope sperm is aspirated from the epididymis. Percutaneous Sperm Aspiration (PESA) is a less invasive technique whereby a small needle is inserted through the skin directly into the epididymis to aspirate sperm.

    <p className='my-3' >In this procedure, eggs are retrieved (as in IVF) from the female partner and under an inverted microscope each egg is injected with a single sperm isolated from the male partner's semen sample by MESA/ TESE/PESA. Broadly in patients with obstructive azoospermia, Dr.A.K.Bansal who is specialised in these surgeries at Jeevan Jyoti Hospital Allahabad is able to collect enough sperm for ICSI.</p>
    <p>Patients with non obstructive azoospermia like mumps, orchitis, testicular disfunction, history of long standing ailments during anti cancer drugs etc. same procedure is followed.</p>
