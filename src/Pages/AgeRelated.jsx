                Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD): Understanding Vision Loss in Aging

                    Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common eye condition that affects the macula, the central part of the retina responsible for sharp, straight-ahead vision. AMD is a leading cause of vision loss in people over 50, and while it doesnâ€™t lead to complete blindness, it can severely impair central vision, making activities like reading and driving difficult.
